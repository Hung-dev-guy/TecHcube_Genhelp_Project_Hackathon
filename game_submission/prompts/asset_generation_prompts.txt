- Prompt 4: "
If you have an image generation tool, generate the 4 icons and floor/wall tiles.

If not, create quick placeholders: colored divs or emoji images (fast).

Place images into game_app/assets/images/. Add sound placeholders into game_app/assets/sounds/ (you can use short generated or royalty-free bleeps â€” or use base64 tiny sounds).

Update index.html and CSS to use icons for quiz tiles and avatars.
Deliverable: game with cartoonish placeholder assets and sound effects.
